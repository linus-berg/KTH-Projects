Alcander Brancozzi
Linus Berg <- Me
Marcus Nilsson

The websites are quite similar in functionality, the main differences occur in the backend,
I used Python, with a Gunicorn server, utilizing Javascript, CSS, and HTML, while the others
had pure CSS/HTML websites. They also used Apache and I used Gunicorn (as noted in report,
if I had to chose I had chosen Nginx to be the outward facing server).

While Alcander and Marcus had static html sites, a lot of mine was dynamic with JSON for the recipes
and generated html using the Jinja templating engine and Javascript.

Everyone had different solutions to the calendar as well, Alcander used lists mixed with grids,
Marcus used grids, and I used pure divs for backwards compatability. The scaling as well was quite similar
for both Marcus and Alcander, while I scaled down vertically instead of scaling the entire calendar.

Other than those, all three sites were quite similar in functionality.
