There was not much difference in the implementation between Jonathan and Alcander,
Linus however used AJAX requests and Postgres compared to their 
PHP post requests and MySQL databases, everyone had a different way to split
up their code, however the SESSION implementations are quite similar.

Everyone followed the requirements in the lab tasks, Jonathan and Alcander had both done the
optional tasks, the reports were fine as well.
