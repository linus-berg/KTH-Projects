The main differences between the three solutions were frameworks and the way AJAX was used,
I used Laravel, Pebo used no framework, and as did Jakob, and no-one used a javascript framework,
because I used Laravel a lot of the authentication functionality was handled automatically by Laravel.

Everyone used jQuery for the ajax requests, no-one used raw javascript, however
I used the 'raw' ajax function, Pebo used post/get functions, and Jakob used get json.

Everyone also meets all the requirements, no-one did any of the optional tasks though,
other than that most of the core functionality between ajax and the server is the same for all three solutions.

The majority of the solutions were very similar except for the php frameworks.
